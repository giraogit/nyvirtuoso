<h2 class="bold">INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE CONCERT</h2>
<h2>With The Canticum Novum Singers, Harold Rosenbaum, Conductor<br />
And The Canticum Novum Youth Choir, Edie Rosenbaum, Director</h2>

<p>Each year the International Day of Peace is observed around the world on 21 September. The General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples.</p>

<p>The first piece, <i>Memorial</i>, which we commissioned from Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Taafe Zwilich, is a tribute to the Sandy Hook victims. Our youth choir sings the names of each child killed tragically that day. </p>

<p>The Canticum Novum Singers will then perform an a cappella piece called <i>Peace</i> by Mark Kilstoft with words by Gerard Manley Hopkins. The poet says, “I hope that you will find this poetic reflection edifying and, as it has for me, lead you to pray for a peace that is substantive and divine. Such peace is not found in the fleeting power reversals and violent victories of human action, but in the surrender of such power and the foregoing of violence that the Gospel calls all humankind to embrace.”</p>

<p>We conclude the first half with <i>The Peaceable Kingdom</i> by Randall Thompson, who was inspired by the painting of the same title by Edward Hicks (1780-1849), the preaching Quaker of Pennsylvania. It illustrates Isaiah XI: 6-9, one of his favorite subjects in preaching and painting. Thompson went to view the painting and became aglow not only with what he saw but also with the biblical passage portrayed (Isaiah, 11:6-9), which ends: "For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." Like Hicks, Thompson was drawn to the theme that the wicked will be destroyed and the good will go to heaven.</p>

<p>The concert concludes with <i>Requiem </i>by Katherine Hoover for choir, soloists, and chamber ensemble. In the words of the composer: “This Requiem was written as a response to the events of September 11, 2001. Finding Walt Whitman’s poetry was a powerful reminder that the tragedies of war and destruction can return; that the human impulse to reach out and help in times of sorrow is universal, and that the great Force that gives life persists and sustains us continually.</p>

<p>It was first performed in November, 2002. Less than 4 months later the prolonged and intense bombing of Baghdad began. I withdrew the piece. </p>

<p>I would now like to dedicate the work to the innocent victims of both bombings: the 3000 killed in the US, and the tens of thousands of men, women, and children who perished in the explosions and flames in Baghdad during March and April, 2003. </p>

<p>Whitman’s moving verses about the Johnstown flood are amazingly pertinent to any such man-made infliction of death and destruction of innocent people. His words of sorrow written after the death of Abraham Lincoln (VI) are among his most loved and comforting.”</p>

<h2><span class="red">Trial and Triumph</span></h2>
<p class="choralTitles">The Riverside Symphony, George Rothman, conducting <br />
  The New York Virtuoso Singers, Harold Rosenbaum, conducting</p>
<p><span class="bold">COPLAND:   In The Beginning</span><br />
  Laura Mercado-Wright, mezzo soprano </p>

  Rachel Schultz, soprano </p>
<p><span class="bold">HANDEL:    Utrecht Jubilate</span></p>
<p>Genesis and war provide the themes for three stunning rarities for chorus and orchestra. Like Copland, American master Andrew Imbrie explores Old Testament “original sin” in his hair-raising oratorio, later widening the lens to embrace both fury and longing in selected American Civil War poetry. Handel’s opus celebrating the end of the War of the Spanish Succession concludes the program in thrilling fashion.</p>
<p>The extraordinarily effective solo mezzo soprano part in “In the Beginning” will be sung by Laura Mercado-Wright, hailed by The New York Times as “superb,” “dramatically astute,” and “stunningly agile.” Harold Rosenbaum conducts.</p>
