<p>To fulfill his dream of conducting the most complex and masterful choral compositions of the 20th and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, in 1988 Mr. Rosenbaum established The New York Virtuoso Singers (<a title="The NEw York Virtuoso Singers" href="http://nyvirtuoso.org/" target="_blank">http://nyvirtuoso.org/</a>), a professional choir.  Now in its 26<sup>th</sup> season, NYVS is regularly invited to perform with leading orchestras and at prestigious institutions such as The Tanglewood Music Festival and The Juilliard School.  It has premiered close to 400 works by renowned contemporary composers such as Berio, Harbison, Henze, Andriessen, Ran, Perle, Krenek, Musgrave, Harvey, Pärt, and Imbrie.</p>
<p>In 1973 Mr. Rosenbaum established The Canticum Novum Singers (<a title="The Canticum Novum Singers" href="http://canticumnovum.org/" target="_blank">www.canticumnovum.org</a>), one of New York’s premiere volunteer choirs presenting music of all periods.  In forty years CNS has performed over 500 concerts nationally and internationally.  Of the 600+ singers who have sung with CNS, over 100 have become professional choristers, soloists, conductors and composers.  CNS has premiered over sixty compositions, including those by Handel, J.C. Bach, Fauré, Bruckner, Harbison, Berio, Schnittke, Rorem, Schickele, and Benjamin.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosenbaum is a much sought-after guest conductor, clinician, adjudicator, funding panelist, coach, lecturer, consultant, and educator.  He has taught at four universities, including The Juilliard School. Currently he is an associate professor at the University at Buffalo/SUNY, where he directs the choirs, heads the graduate program in choral conducting, and teaches other courses.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/HR-DelTredici.jpg"><img title="HR-DelTredici" alt="" src="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/HR-DelTredici-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Harold Rosenbaum, composer David Del Tredici</p></div>
<p>Fulfilling his lifelong passion to bring together choral singers from different backgrounds and skill levels, over the past 41 years Mr. Rosenbaum has founded The Canticum Novum Festival Choir, Westchester Oratorio Society, Long Island Jewish Choral Society, and Westchester Jewish Choral Society in addition to NYVS and CNS.  As conductor of eight university choirs, seven church choirs, ten synagogue choirs, two youth choirs, and a senior adult choir, Mr. Rosenbaum has conducted close to 1,600 concerts with these choirs and combinations of them.  Such collaborations include the Verdi Requiem at Carnegie Hall with seven choirs, and Haydn’s Creation with the Queens College Preparatory Choir, Transfiguration Lutheran Church Choir of Harlem, and Westchester Jewish Choral Society.  For that concert Mr. Rosenbaum was awarded <i>The Most Remarkable Ecumenical Achievement Award</i> by The New York Times.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosenbaum’s productivity is prodigious.  During one season he was artistic director of eleven choirs.  During another season he was a full-time professor at both the University at Buffalo and Queens College while conducting five non-university choirs. To celebrate The Canticum Novum Singers’ 25th season, Mr. Rosenbaum conducted twenty-five Bach cantatas, eleven in one day.  During one 3‑1/2 week period, he conducted Verdi’s Requiem in Carnegie Hall, a three-hour world premiere in Avery Fisher Hall, Bach’s St. John Passion, and a concert of modern music with The New York Virtuoso Singers.  At The Tanglewood Music Center, he conducted seven modern works in the afternoon and three more that evening in the “Prelude” concert for the Boston Symphony.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenbaum typically works on 15-20 current and future projects at once.  One past project from 19__ stands out for its broad scope and ambition:  a co-production with Merkin Concert Hall, with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, of “Voices of the Century,” a series of six concerts presenting 50 of the greatest <i>a cappella</i> pieces of the 20th century from 13 countries.</p>

<h3><strong>Honoring the &#8216;Uphill Battle&#8217; of a Champion of New Choral Music</strong><strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>By ROBERTA HERSHENSON, THE NEW YORK TIMES<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/22composerwe.html?ex=1371960000&amp;en=7656f3a8c33ec1de&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" target="blank">Published: June 22, 2008</a></p>
<p>The conductor Harold Rosenbaum, recent recipient of the Laurel Leaf Award from the American Composers Alliance, sees choral composers today as a neglected species. Avocational or school choruses, which account for most choruses in the United States, are reluctant to tackle music they fear will be overly complex, he says. Music publishers fear contemporary works will be too atonal to sell. But Mr. Rosenbaum has made it his mission to open resistant minds and ears. &#8220;There’s so much wonderful contemporary choral music out there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Composers are very frustrated.&#8221;<em></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<div><strong><a href="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5_GolijovRosenbaumSm_optimized3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-287" title="5_GolijovRosenbaumSm_optimized" alt="" src="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5_GolijovRosenbaumSm_optimized3.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />

<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<p><em> </em>So it was not surprising that when Mr. Rosenbaum received his award in Manhattan on June 4 – presented in recognition of &#8220;distinguished achievement in fostering and encouraging the performance of new American works&#8221; – he deferred to composers themselves in his acceptance speech. &#8220;I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for gifted composers around the country,&#8221; he said from the stage. &#8220;I wouldn’t be here tonight if it weren’t for their unbelievable talent and passion for the music of our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenbaum, who lives in South Salem, joins a prestigious list of previous winners of the award, which has been given yearly since 1951. These include the Juilliard String Quartet and noted symphony conductors like Leonard Slatkin, Leopold Stokowski and George Szell. After the award ceremony, which was held after intermission during a concert of new music that Mr. Rosenbaum conducted, he asked, with a smile, to be allowed to &#8220;get back to work.&#8221; Then he led the New York Virtuoso Singers, a professional chorus he founded 20 years ago, in works by Louis Karchin, John Eaton and Steven R. Gerber, among others. Many of the composers on the program were in the audience.<em></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<div><em><em><a href="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/6_DSC00151sm_optimized.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-288" title="6_DSC00151sm_optimized" alt="" src="http://www.haroldrosenbaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/6_DSC00151sm_optimized.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></em></em><strong>Harold Rosenbaum, composer John Corigliano</strong></div>
<p><em> </em>After a rehearsal with the New York Virtuoso Singers a week earlier, Mr. Rosenbaum said he hoped the award, with its highlight on American music, would help build interest in music written today. &#8220;Maybe people will be more curious about this body of work, most of which is lying dormant,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every time I’m onstage conducting great music, it makes up for the struggle.&#8221; He referred several times to the &#8220;uphill battle&#8221; he and other orchestral conductors face in championing new works.<em></em></p>
<p><em></em>At 58, with gray shoulder-length hair that neatly skims the back of his tuxedo, Mr. Rosenbaum seems to be thriving on his efforts. At any one time, he said, he is working on 15 to 20 projects involving one of his seven choruses. These include the 35-year-old Canticum Novum Singers, which performs music from Bach to Schnittke, and two choruses at the University of Buffalo, where, as a full-time faculty member, he spends one and a half days each week. Composers constantly send him new works; he has received nearly 3,000 scores during the past 20 years, he said, and has performed about 100 of them. Mr. Rosenbaum also edits a choral series established in his name by G. Schirmer, the music publisher. After the interview, he said, he was returning home to study an opera score by Marie Barker Nelson, one of Hindemith’s students, that he plans to conduct in 2010.<br />

<div></div>
<p><em></em>Volunteers help him raise the money for these projects by writing grant proposals, he said, but finances are a perpetual challenge. The New York Virtuoso concert at Symphony Space, for example, employed 8 singers instead of the chorus’s usual 16, for budgetary reasons. The singers are plucked from a roster of 300 to 400 professionals. (Information and concert schedules for the New York Virtuoso Singers and also for the Canticum Novum Singers can be found at <a href="../" target="blank">www.haroldrosenbaum.com</a>.)<em></em></p>
<p><em></em>Mr. Rosenbaum’s dream, which he spoke of wistfully, is that some major institution — say, Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall — would take a professional chorus like New York Virtuoso under its wing as a full-time resident ensemble, something akin to the European model of full-time employment for performing artists. Hearts and minds might not instantly be changed toward contemporary music, but he believes the music would win out eventually. &#8220;The trick,&#8221; he said, is to present audiences with &#8220;the very best.&#8221;</p>
