The choral music of Nancy Wertsch is expertly written and appealing on a number of fronts...The New York Virtuoso Singers, under the capable leadership of Harold Rosenbaum, achieve a superb blend, enhanced by meticulous intonation (not an easy feat where there are no instruments upon which to secure one’s tuning). This is a remarkable CD in every parameter, and is highly recommended to anyone with the slightest interest in superb choral music and performance.<br />

          It was an inspired idea to perform “The Creation” on 12-21-12 … (Mr. Rosenbaum) drew a radiant and joyous performance of this 100-minute score from the top-notch St. Luke’s players and the skilled Virtuoso Singers. … The singing of the Virtuoso Singers under Mr. Rosenbaum was full-bodied, confident and nuanced.<br />

          Mr. Rosenbaum has been a stalwart on the New York choral scene for decades, most notably with his professional chorus, the New York Virtuoso Singers.<br />

  For more than two decades, New York City audiences have been able to count on Rosenbaum's commitment to contemporary choral music for artistic excellence and integrity. A relationship of camaraderie, respect and trust exists among the musicians, the composers, Rosenbaum and The New York Virtuoso Singers' audiences. This first concert of the celebratory season had an almost intimate feel to it: this was not an afternoon of pomp and grandeur, but of artistic conviviality and musical felicity.</p>
        <p>The composers who work with Rosenbaum have the happy knowledge that there is little they might compose that The New York Virtuoso Singers can't perform: contemporary composers can count absolutely on these singers' stunning musicianship and superb technique.</p>
        <p>The Canticum Novum Youth Choir sang Richard Rice's setting of the fifteenth century anonymous folk-hymn “Adam lay y-Bounden” with skill and sweetness; the final “Deo gratias!” was sturdy and confident.<br />

          Now this is the way for an ensemble to celebrate an anniversary. The New York Virtuoso Singers, founded 25 years ago by the conductor Harold Rosenbaum, are an invaluable professional chamber choir that focuses on American contemporary music. … It takes confidence for an ensemble to put the word “virtuoso” in its name. The New York Virtuoso Singers have long earned it. All the performances were excellent.<br />

          Rosenbaum's direction of The New York Virtuoso Singers and the Salomé Chamber Orchestra was, as always, authoritative, fluent and clear. Especially when he conducts new works, Rosenbaum's important gifts include an ability to make musicians feel at ease with material they have only recently encountered for the first time.<br />

          Any audience attending a performance by the New York Virtuoso Singers, founded and directed by Harold Rosenbaum, can reasonably and accurately expect to hear gorgeous choral music. The audience who attended the May 13 concert had all their expectations met. The singing of each piece of this stylistically eclectic collection of works was marvelous. The New York Virtuoso Singers excel in music that presupposes the discipline of classical music training and demands the technical facility to navigate even the most unexpected contemporary musical challenges to the inherited Western tradition. The New York Virtuoso Singers are a superb chorus: the singers trust each other, their director and the music itself. The musicianship of the chorus, both individually and as a whole, together with Harold Rosenbaum's clarity of purpose, makes the performance of each piece a renewed inhabitation of each composer's creative intent rather than just a repetition of the notes on the score.<br />

          It is always such a pleasure to work with Harold Rosenbaum and his NYVS. What sheer professionalism and dedication! So very much appreciated at any time, but perhaps especially so in these difficult economic times.<br />

          Dear Harold,<br />
  I wanted to express my heartfelt and sincere appreciation to you and to the wonderful group of 12 amazing singers you have assembled for the performance of my Credo/Ani Ma'amin.</p>
        <p>I was not able to speak with each and every one of you after the concert, but hopefully this message will be forwarded to all.</p>
        <p>The performance was really splendid, in every way. The singing was truly beautiful -- such immaculate pitch, precision, and a sense of &quot;ownership&quot;: each and every one of you fully in charge of your music, whether solo or as part of the ensemble, singing expressively and with passion. The narrated sections were uniformly excellent, conveying the emotion of it all in just the right way. Tempi and pacing were right on throughout (bravo Harold!).</p>
        <p>Your performance was everything it should have been musically, but it was clear that you also really &quot;got it&quot; at the human level and communicated your understanding to the listener powerfully and with great feeling.</p>
        <p>I feel really indebted, and grateful.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Harold, for making happen this first New York performance of the FULL version of a work that means so much to me, as a composer and as a human being.</p>
  <p>I hope we all meet and collaborate again, soon!</p>
        <p>With warm regards,<br />
