      A tireless proponent and advocate for contemporary composers and American
      composers in particular, Mr. Rosenbaum has created an annual choral
      composition competition, commissioned 51 works, conducted over 450 world
      premieres (including works by Ravel [in Paris], Schoenberg, Schnittke,
      Carter, Henze, Berio, Perle, Harbison, Corigliano, Lang, Ran, Zwilich,
      Adamo, Ran, Musgrave, Bolcom, Danielpour, Thomas, Wyner, Tower, and
      Kernis), and recorded contemporary choral music on over thirty commercial
      CD’s for SONY Classical, Albany, CRI, Bridge, Koch International,
      Soundbrush, KASP, Capstone, MSR Classics,  DRG, and Our Silent Canvas. 
      Mr. Rosenbaum is Lead Choral Conductor for Parma Recordings and a

      <br />
      In recognition of his leadership in the interpretation and performance of
      contemporary music, G. Schirmer publishes the Harold Rosenbaum Choral
      Series, for which Mr. Rosenbaum composes, edits, and gives performance
      suggestions for conductors.<br />
      <br />
      To fulfill his dream of conducting the most complex and masterful choral
      compositions of the 20th and 21st centuries, in 1988 Mr. Rosenbaum
      established <a target="_blank" href="http://nyvirtuoso.org/">The New York
        Virtuoso Singers</a>, a professional choir.  Now in its 26th season,
      NYVS is regularly invited to perform with leading orchestras and at
      prestigious institutions such as The Tanglewood Music Festival and The
      Juilliard School.  It has premiered close to 400 works by renowned
      contemporary composers such as Berio, Harbison, Henze, Andriessen, Ran,
      Perle, Krenek, Musgrave, Harvey, Pärt, and Imbrie.<br />
      <br />
      In 1973 Mr. Rosenbaum established <a target="_blank" href="www.canticumnovum.org/">The
        Canticum Novum Singers</a>, one of New York’s premiere volunteer choirs
      presenting music of all periods.  In forty years CNS has performed over
      500 concerts nationally and internationally.  Of the 600+ singers who have
      sung with CNS, over 100 have become professional choristers, soloists,
      conductors and composers.  CNS has premiered over sixty compositions,
      including those by Handel, J.C. Bach, Fauré, Bruckner, Harbison, Berio,
      Schnittke, Rorem, Schickele, and Benjamin.<br />
      <br />
      Mr. Rosenbaum is a much sought-after guest conductor, clinician,
      adjudicator, funding panelist, coach, lecturer, consultant, and educator. 
      He has taught at four universities, including The Juilliard School.
      Currently he is an associate professor at the University at Buffalo/SUNY,
      where he directs the choirs, heads the graduate program in choral
      conducting, and teaches other courses.<br />
      <br />
      Fulfilling his lifelong passion to bring together choral singers from
      different backgrounds and skill levels, over the past 41 years Mr.
      Rosenbaum has founded The Canticum Novum Festival Choir, Westchester
      Oratorio Society, Long Island Jewish Choral Society, and Westchester
      Jewish Choral Society in addition to NYVS and CNS.  As conductor of eight
      university choirs, seven church choirs, ten synagogue choirs, two youth
      choirs, and a senior adult choir, Mr. Rosenbaum has conducted close to
      1,600 concerts with these choirs and combinations of them.  Such
      collaborations include the Verdi Requiem at Carnegie Hall with seven
      choirs, and Haydn’s Creation with the Queens College Preparatory Choir,
      Transfiguration Lutheran Church Choir of Harlem, and Westchester Jewish
      Choral Society.  For that concert Mr. Rosenbaum was awarded The Most
      Remarkable Ecumenical Achievement Award by The New York Times.<br />
      Mr. Rosenbaum’s productivity is prodigious.  During one season he was
      artistic director of eleven choirs.  During another season he was a
      full-time professor at both the University at Buffalo and Queens College
      while conducting five non-university choirs. To celebrate The Canticum
      Novum Singers’ 25th season, Mr. Rosenbaum conducted twenty-five Bach
      cantatas, eleven in one day.  During one 3 1/2 week period, he conducted
      Verdi’s Requiem in Carnegie Hall, a three-hour world premiere in Avery
      Fisher Hall, Bach’s St. John Passion, and a concert of modern music with
      The New York Virtuoso Singers.  At The Tanglewood Music Center, he
      conducted seven modern works in the afternoon and three more that evening
      in the “Prelude” concert for the Boston Symphony.<br />
      Mr. Rosenbaum typically works on 15-20 current and future projects at
      once.  One past project stands out for its broad scope and ambition:  a
      co-production with Merkin Concert Hall, with a grant from the National
      Endowment for the Arts, of “Voices of the Century,” a series of six
      concerts presenting 50 of the greatest a cappella pieces of the 20th
      century from 13 countries.<br />
